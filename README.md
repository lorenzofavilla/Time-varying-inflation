Hi there!
This project was part of the course "Advanced methods for portfolio and risk management" taught by Professor Guidolin at Bocconi University.
It consists in the replication of the paper "Time-varying inflation risk and stock returns" by Martijn Boons, Fernando Duarte, Frans de Roonc, Marta Szymanowska,
The original code was taken from Duarte github (https://fernandoduarte.github.io/).
Feel free to reach out!
Lorenzo
